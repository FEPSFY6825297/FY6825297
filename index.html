Digital data production is growing at unprecedented rates, meaning current methods of data storage are becoming
Insufficient to keep up with the amount of data that needs to be stored. While still a developing field,
a promising solution to this issue is DNA storage. DNA storage achieves a much higher storage density (Buko, T., Tuczko, N. and Ishikawa, T. 2023)
and has promising potential in terms of durability. Converting digital data into DNA is a process based on binary code
where a specific nucleotide relates to a specific code (00=Adenine,01=cytosine...). The digital data is encoded and translated into a DNA sequence
using computer algorithms and then synthesised. In vivo methods of storage see DNA data storage coming closer to realising its potential for Long-term storage. 
To extract digital information from DNA storage, The DNA needs to be sequenced (a process used to identify the sequence of bases in a DNA sequence) and then decoded
to return the digital data back to its original form.

Digital Data production has been growing exponentially (Ceze, L., Nivala, J. and Strauss, k., 2019), outpacing growth of the installed base
(all devices in active use). While the total amount of data in 2011 was approximately 5 ZB (5 trillion Gigabytes), it reached 79 ZB in 2021 and continues to display rapid growth.
It is expected to reach 181 ZB in 2025 (Statista research department, 2022).

Most generated data is discarded, but a fraction still needs to be stored. Due to their cost, space requirements and energy consumption during the recording,
storing and reading of data, current methods of data storage such as magnetic (e.g. hard disk drives), optical (e.g., Blu-ray disks) and solid-state(e.g., flash drives)
are not enough to accommodate such rapid growth (Buko,T., Tuczko, N. and Ishikawa, T. 2023).
Another problem with these methods of data storage is that their durability reaches a maximum of 50 years when in optimal conditions (Grass et al.,2015).
Thus, there is need for a new data storage medium with higher capacity, data density and high durability against extreme conditions. 
             
Using as few atoms as possible to store one bit of information leads to higher data density, making molecular data storage attractive (Ceze, L., Nivala, J. and Strauss, k., 2019).
Among the many forms of molecular-level data storage DNA is one of the most promising next-generation data carriers. It has a storage density of 10<sup>19</sup> bits of data per cubic centimetre,
and its three-dimensional structure makes it approximately eight orders of magnitude denser than other storage media (Buko, T., Tuczko, N. and Ishikawa, T. 2023).

An article by (Buko, T., Tuczko, N. and Ishakawa, T. 2023) describes that transcribing data into DNA begins with encoding. 
Encoding information into a sequence of DNA Is based on binary code, where a nucleotide corresponds to a specific code e.g. 00 = A, 01 = C, 10 = G and 11 = T. 
When binary data is translated into a DNA sequence, it is vital that the creation of long homopolymers (DNA polymer whose nucleotide sequence has more than three of the same nucleotides in a row) is avoided,
as well as unreasonable GC content (The percentage of nitrogenous bases in a DNA molecule that are either Guanine or Cytosine) as these may lead to mistakes being generated during the synthesis and sequencing 
(the process by which the nucleotide sequence of a string of DNA is read) of DNA strings. The process of encoding a file requires converting text into a code such as ASCII,
A system that is used to convert letters numbers, symbols, and other text elements into a language that computers understand, or Base 64 (like ASCII) and then converting the newly coded file into a binary system.
This process is carried out using a computer algorithm which maps strings of bits (the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store) into DNA sequences.
